# odin-recipes
The first TOP project.

For this project, the task was to create a simple, unintentionally brutalist recipe website. For my three dishes I chose Pork green chili, a Spicy chicken sandwhich, and Rocky Mountain Oysters. Two of these dishes are close to me as they are staples in the community I live in, even though I haven't tried one of them.

As for skills gained thorugh this project, I had to demonstrate basic knowledge of html, git, and GitHub; as well as use of the terminal to make navigation easier. I am eagar to keep building my knowledge of these fundamental concepts, while also learning new skills along the way. The sky's the limit!
