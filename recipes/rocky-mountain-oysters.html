      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        They are also known as prairie oysters, Montana tendergroins, cowboy
        caviar, swinging beef, and calf fries – are true Western delicacies.
        They are that part of the bull that is removed in his youth so that he
        may thereby be more tractable, grow meatier, and behave less masculine.
        When the calves are branded, the testicles are cut off and thrown in a
        bucket of water. They are then peeled, washed, rolled in flour and
        pepper, and fried in a pan.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are considered to be quite a delicacy. Like other organ meats,
        testicles may be cooked in a variety of ways – deep-fried whole, cut
        into broad, thin slices, or marinated. At roundups in the old West,
        cowboys and ranch hands tossed the meat on a hot iron stove. When the
        calf fries exploded, they were done?

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lbs calf testicles*</li>
        <li>2 cups beer</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil**</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          With a very sharp knife, split the tough skin-like muscle that
          surrounds each testicle. Remove the skin (you can remove the skin
          easily if the testicles are frozen, then peel while thawing). Either
          leave whole or slice each testicle into approximately 1/4- to
          1/2-inch-thick ovals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place slices in a large pan or blow with enough beer to cover them;
          cover and let sit 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a shallow bowl, combine eggs, flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper to
          make a wet flour dredge or closer to a batter consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove testicles from beer; drain and dredge thoroughly in the wet
          flour dredge.
        </li>
        <li>
          n a large, deep pot, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Deep fry 3 minutes or
          until golden brown (will rise to the surface when done). Drain on
          paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite hot pepper sauce.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          * Be sure to ask your butcher for calf testicles, not bull testicles.
          Calf testicles are the size of a walnut and are much more tender than
          the larger bull testicles.
        </li>
        <li>
          ** Use enough vegetable oil to fill your frying container halfway to
          the top to allow for bubbling up and splattering and to completely
          cover calf testicles while frying.
        </li>
      </ul>
