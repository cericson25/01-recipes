    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who’s really winning the chicken sandwich wars? This baby … that’s who. Featuring crispy, crunchy, restaurant-style fried chicken drenched in a hot and buttery Frank’s RedHot® Original Hot Sauce concoction and served on pillowy rolls, this spicy chicken sandwich is #1 in our book. (But hey, may the best sammie win!)</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup Frank's RedHot® Original Cayenne Pepper Hot Sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup butter milk, divided</li>
            <li>6 thinly sliced boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets, (about 1 pound)</li>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>6 soft white sandwhich rolls</li>
            <li>Dill pickle slices, optional</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>WHISK 1/2 cup of the RedHot Sauce and 2/3 cup of the buttermilk in large bowl. Add chicken, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or longer for more flavor.</li>
            <li>MIX flour and baking powder in large bowl. Stir in remaining 1/3 cup buttermilk using a large fork. With clean hands, rub flour mixture between palms until mixture is completely blended and resembles wet sand. Transfer to shallow baking dish.</li>
            <li>REMOVE chicken from marinade. Place chicken in flour mixture, one piece at a time, pressing to coat completely on both sides. Discard remaining marinade and flour mixture.</li>
            <li>HEAT oil to 375°F in 10-inch skillet. Fry chicken, two pieces at a time, about 4 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towel-lined plate; keep warm.</li>
            <li>MIX remaining 1/4 cup RedHot Sauce and butter in small bowl. Brush fried chicken evenly with sauce mixture. Serve chicken on rolls with pickles, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
