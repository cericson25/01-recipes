      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is one of the easiest and most popular of the green chili recipes.
        It has tomatoes in it and is slightly thickened. Sometimes I’ll take 2
        crockpots to a party – one made with all mild and one that’s half mild
        and half hot to satisfy the real chile heads.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. cubed pork</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. minced garlic (about 2 cloves)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. flour</li>
        <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes (or substitute 1 14 oz can)</li>
        <li>1 14.5 oz can chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1.2 cups diced green chiles (about 20 chiles)</li>
        <li>2 cups diced onion</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Brown pork in skillet with garlic and pepper. Add flour and brown as
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          In crock pot, mix pork, garlic, tomatoes, water, green chiles and
          onion. Simmer for at least 2 hours. Water can be added to thin down
          and flour can be added to thicken. You can also cook it in a large pot
          on the stove at low heat
        </li>
        <li>
          Let simmer at least an hour before tasting and modifying by adding
          chiles, more tomatoes, garlic, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is a very meaty, very slightly thickened chili – thin for
          Colorado style chili. If you like really thick chili, use 4-5 tbsp.
          flour rather than 3 and/or reduce the water.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some people may like it thicker, in which case you can add 1 to 2 tbsp
          flour or reduce the water.
        </li>
        <li>
          I typically use about 2/3 mild and 1/3 hot green chiles. I generally
          like green chili that is not super hot but has a definite kick.
        </li>
      </ul>
