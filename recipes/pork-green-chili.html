        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of the easiest and most popular of the green chili recipes. It has tomatoes in it and is slightly thickened. Some like it thicker, in which case you add 1 to 2 tbsp flour or reduce the water.

            <p>
                I typically use about 2/3 mild and 1/3 hot green chiles.  I generally like green chili that is not super hot but has a definite kick. Sometimes I’ll take 2 crockpots to a party – one made with all mild and one that’s half mild and half hot to satisfy the real chile heads.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs. cubed pork</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. minced garlic (about 2 cloves)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>3 tbsp. flour</li>
                <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes (or substitute 1 14 oz can)</li>
                <li>1 14.5 oz can chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>2 1.2 cups diced green chiles (about 20 chiles)</li>
                <li>2 cups diced onion</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown pork in skillet with garlic and pepper. Add flour and brown as well.</li>
                <li>In crock pot, mix pork, garlic, tomatoes, water, green chiles and onion. Simmer for at least 2 hours. Water can be added to thin down and flour can be added to thicken. You can also cook it in a large pot on the stove at low heat</li>
                <li>Let simmer at least an hour before tasting and modifying by adding chiles, more tomatoes, garlic, etc.</li>
                <li>This is a very meaty, very slightly thickened chili – thin for Colorado style chili. If you like really thick chili, use 4-5 tbsp. flour rather than 3 and/or reduce the water.</li>
            </ol>
